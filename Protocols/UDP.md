The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a fire-and-forget approach to network communications. It relies on IP addresses and port numbers, similar to [TCP](TCP.md) but doesn't have such a complex handshake process and no guaranteed order of delivery. Therefore UDP is often used in scenarios where some missing packets aren't detrimental to the user experience, for example in video streaming.
